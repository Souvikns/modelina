# Go Union Types

Modelina now supports union types for `Go`. Since `Go` does not have native union types support modelina uses `struct embeddings` to mock union types.


## How to run this example

Run this example using:

```sh
npm i && npm run start
```

If you are on Windows, use the `start:windows` script instead:

```sh
npm i && npm run start:windows
```
